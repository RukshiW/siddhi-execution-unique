If a new event that arrives within the window time period has a value for the key parameter which matches that of an existing event, the existing event expires and it is replaced by the later event. </p></div>

When a new event arrives with the key that is already there in the window, then the previous event is expired and new event is kept within the window.</p></div>
* <a target="_blank" href="./api/4.0.2-SNAPSHOT/#firstlengthbatch-window">firstLengthBatch</a> *(<a target="_blank" href="https://wso2.github.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-4.0/#windows">Window</a>)*<br><div style="padding-left: 1em;"><p>This is a batch (tumbling) window that holds a specific number of unique events (depending on which events arrive first). The unique events are selected based on a specific parameter that is considered as the unique key. When a new event arrives with a value for the unique key parameter that matches the same of an existing event in the window, that event is not processed by the window.</p></div>

It holds the latest unique events that arrived during the last window time period. The unique events are determined based on the value for a specified unique key parameter. When a new event arrives within the time window with a value for the unique key parameter that is the same as that of an existing event in the window, the existing event expires and it is replaced by the later event.</p></div>

The unique events are determined based on the value for a specified unique key parameter. The window is updated for every window length (i.e., for the last set of events of the specified number in a tumbling manner).
